I am interesting to know how the Climate Changes impacts afecct to ectomycorrhizal communities in Nothofagus forest in Patagonia argentine. For this purpose, 
I used natural gradients to study this commiunities. I also espect to generate future distribution models of Nothofagus forest and their ectomycorrhizal 
comunities associated.
